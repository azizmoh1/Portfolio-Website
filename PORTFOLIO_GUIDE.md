# Beginner Guide: Build Your Portfolio Website

This project is intentionally simple: plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 1) File Structure

- `index.html`: Home page (includes resume download button)
- `projects.html`: Project list page
- `skills.html`: Skills and certifications page
- `contact.html`: Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links
- `styles.css`: Shared design and animations
- `script.js`: Mobile menu + reveal animation + footer year

## 2) How to Run It

Open `/Users/azizmohammad/Documents/New project/index.html` in your browser.

If you use VS Code, you can install "Live Server" and run the folder as a local website.

## 3) Customize It (First Pass)

1. Replace `Your Name` on each page.
2. Put your resume file in this folder as `resume.pdf`.
3. Update contact links in `contact.html`:
   - `mailto:youremail@example.com`
   - LinkedIn URL
   - GitHub URL
4. Edit the hero text in `index.html` with your own summary.

## 4) Add Projects Later

In `projects.html`, each card has placeholders:

- project title
- short summary
- tech tags
- project detail link
- screenshot area

When ready, replace placeholders with real data and screenshots.

## 5) Why This Structure Works for Resume Use

- Multi-page layout looks professional and organized.
- Shared CSS keeps design consistent across pages.
- Recruiters can quickly scan and then go deeper.
- You can scale by adding more project cards and detail pages.

## 6) Next Upgrade Options

1. Create one detailed page per project.
2. Add screenshots to each card.
3. Add a GitHub repo + live demo button per project.
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages for a public link on your resume.
